        <h2>
          Japanese cuisine is well liked for it's freshness and health benefits, as it's ingredients are largely unprocessed,
          and there tends to be little sugary foods. Traditional Japanese cuisine tends to be based on rice and miso soup,
          with side dishes containing fish or vegetables. The national dish of Japan is Curry Rice. Fun fact: Ramen, one of
          Japan's most popular dishes, was actually made in China!

            - Contrary to what one would assume, in Japan, it's actually good manners and a sign of enjoyment to slurp your
            noodles.
            - do: rest chopsticks on plate/bowl rim, aka the side of your dish.
            do NOT: stick chopsticks into the bowl, or your food (seen as bad luck, rude, death omen due to resemblance to
            shrine incense, etc)
            (pro tip: this manner tends to bleed into other cuisines, so to be safe, don't leave your chopsticks in your food!)
            - Do not: Give tip in Japan, as it's considered unnecessary and possibly rude.
            - Some polite phrases: "Itadakimasu (いただきます)" which is said as a thank you before a meal, similar to saying
            grace--and "gochisousamadeshita (ごちそうさまでした)" which is said as a thank you after a meal.
